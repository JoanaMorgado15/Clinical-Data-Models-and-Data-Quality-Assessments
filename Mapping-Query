For data quality and to highlight that the values in the table are the same, I decided to calculate the common commands for numeric data types in SQL: min for the minimum, max for the maximum, avg for mean, sum for sum. The mean and sum do not stay the same if some values have been wrongly transformed.


I used the following queries:
SELECT min(SUBJECT_ID) as min_SUBJECT_ID, max(SUBJECT_ID) as max_SUBJECT_ID, avg(SUBJECT_ID) as mean_SUBJECT_ID, sum (SUBJECT_ID) as sum_SUBJECT_ID FROM mimic3_demo.DIAGNOSES_ICD
SELECT min(person_id) as min_person_id, max(person_id) as max_ person_id, avg(person_id) as mean_ person_id, sum (person_id) as sum_ person_id FROM CONDITION_OCCURENCE
SELECT min(HADM_ID) as min_ HADM_ID, max(HADM_ID) as max_ HADM_ID, avg(HADM_ID) as mean_ HADM_ID, sum (HADM_ID) as sum_ HADM_ID FROM mimic3_demo.DIAGNOSES_ICD
SELECT min(visit_occurrence_id) as min_ visit_occurrence_id, max(visit_occurrence_id) as max_ visit_occurrence_id, avg(visit_occurrence_id) as mean_ visit_occurrence_id, sum (visit_occurrence_id) as sum_ visit_occurrence_id FROM CONDITION_OCCURENCE

For data quality I checked the ICD9 codes in the MIMIC-III against OMOPâ€™s condition_source_value by computing their minimum, maximum and unique codes present.

I computed the following queries:
SELECT min(ICD9_CODE) as min_ICD9_CODE, max(ICD9_CODE) as max_ICD9_CODE, count(DISTINCT ICD9_CODE) as n_ICD9_CODE from mimic3_demo.DIAGNOSES_ICD

SELECT min(condition_source_value) as min_csv, max(condition_source_value) as max_csv, count(DISTINCT condition_source_value) as n_csv from CONDITION_OCCURENCE
